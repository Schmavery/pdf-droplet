# PDF Droplet

I couldn't find a PDF viewer that would show me the object level data. This uses internal PDFjs APIs to do the parsing/rendering.

# TODO

- better support for struct tree stuff, maybe an alternative tree view vs the object list??
- toggle/edit drawing commands, see the change visually
- filter out struct tree elems, objstm
- ???
